# Rhonin
Rhonin is a StarCraft AI Bot based on BWAPI/BWMirror(Java).

The reason I chose Java is simply because I think it is more intuitive than C++. Previously, my programming experience was limited to python/deeplearning related projects.

The reason why I tried to make an SC AI Bot is that the SCBot is a blue ocean. The bot developers lack understanding of the game.
